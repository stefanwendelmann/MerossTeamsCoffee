Cheap Wifi Smart Plug MSS310 from Meross, wich is measuring the current power consumption.

![merross smartplug mss310 EU](img/meross_mss310_eu.jpeg)

Yes i know, its not a coffeemaker, did not have one at home, but it follows the same principal, measure current power consumption, if it changes from 0 Watts to > 0 Watts make a message.

# üéØ Getting Started
## üìÑ Dependencies / Requirements
- A coffeemaker (or other device you want to monitor wich has 0 W power consumption in off state and switching back to it after work is done)
- Meross MSS310 (feel free to extend with other Meross devices) https://www.meross.com/Detail/6/Smart%20Wi-Fi%20Plug%20with%20Energy%20Monitor
- Wifi with internet connection
- Smartphone (Meross App currently supports Android 4.1 or later and iOS 9 )
- Microsoft Teams
- A machine running Docker (or cloud with k8s)
- PostgreSQL DB (maybe also on Docker)

## üíæ Setup DB

Get yourself a PostgreSQL DB, or run one on docker.

````shell
docker run --name coffee_postgres -p 5432:5432 -e "TZ=GMT+2" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=coffee -e POSTGRES_DB=coffee -v ${PWD}/db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres
````

Connect to DB and setup the DDL

````postgresql
create table brews
(
	id serial not null
		constraint brews_pkey
			primary key,
	created_date timestamp not null,
	"startOrStop" boolean not null
);

alter table brews owner to postgres;
````

## üîå Install Smart Plug

* Install your Smart Plug and follow the instructions of the meross User Manual.
* Change the name of the device in the app to a for your meross environment unique name.
* Let the Smart Plug turned on

## üõ† Config the Webhook in Teams channel

* Choose a Teams channel u want to use
* Click on the 3 dots behind the name of the chanel to open the menu
* Choose connectors (if its missing ask your admin for permission or help)
* Add a "Incoming Webhook"
* Name it (Maybe CoffeeBot) and give it a nice icon (will be the "profile" icon the bot is sending messages)
* Save and copy the webhook url and paste it into the environment variable for the docker container start

This will be your unique Webhook URL this tool will send a Message with, keep it secret!
